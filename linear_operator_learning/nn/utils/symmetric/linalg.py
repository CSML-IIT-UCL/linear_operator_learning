def invariant_orthogonal_projector(rep_X: Representation) -> torch.Tensor:
    r"""Computes the orthogonal projection to the invariant subspace.

    The representation `rep_X` is transformed to the spectral basis using the change of basis matrix `Q`:

    .. math::
        rep_X = Q (\bigoplus_i^n \\hat{\rho}_i) Q^T

    The projection is performed by:
        1. Change basis to representation spectral basis (exposing signals per irrep).
        2. Zero out all signals on irreps that are not trivial.
        3. Map back to original basis set.

    Args:
        rep_X (Representation): The representation for which the orthogonal projection to the invariant subspace is computed.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The orthogonal projection matrix to the invariant subspace. Q S Q^T
